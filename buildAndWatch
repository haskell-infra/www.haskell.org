Usage: buildAndWatch [buildMode]

Build the haskell.org site builder, compile the site, and start a
local server on port 8000 to preview changes.

buildAndWatch takes a single optional argument, 'buildMode'. If it's
omitted, buildAndWatch will attempt to select the best method for
building the site based on your current environment. If you provide an
argument, it may be one of the following:

  auto (default)      Automatically select between 'nix' or 'cabal' based on the
                        current environment.
  nix                 Use nix to build the site
  cabal               Use cabal to build the site. If you are in a nix shell,
                        it will use your nix environment. Otherwise, it will use
                        your system-wide cabal installation.
