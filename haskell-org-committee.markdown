## Haskell.org Committee

The Haskell.org Committee serves as the board of directors for Haskell.org. Its responsibilities include:

  * setting the policy for [haskell.org] domain and subdomains
  * setting policy for servers owned or financed by Haskell.org
  * overseeing Haskell.org donations and funds

### Committee Membership

The committee consists of 7 members serving 3-year terms. The current members are:

  * Ryan Trinkle (term ends 2020)
  * Tikhon Jelvis (term ends 2020)
  * George Wilson (term ends 2020)
  * Emily Pillmore (term ends 2021)
  * Jasper Van der Jeugt (Chair) (term ends 2022)
  * Rebecca Skinner (term ends 2022)
  * Alexandre Garcia de Oliveira (term ends 2022)

At the end of each year—or if a member steps down before their term is over—the committee holds an open call for new members, encouraging self-nominations. Committee members whose terms are over are eligible for renomination.

After nominations have been solicited, the current committee—including any outgoing members—selects new members with a simple majority vote.
