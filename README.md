# Haskell.org Website

This is the website for www.haskell.org built as a hakyll static site, which builds both as a nix derivation and a standalone cabal project. Issues with the site can be raised in this repository, and PRs can be made to change content. More general administrative issues with the site or related haskell.org infrastructure are better raised directly with the admin team on the #haskell-infrastructure channel on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/), or at the admin@[LANGUAGE].org email address.

### Subsites

Not all subsites of www.haskell.org are built from this repository.
Some of the others are

* www.haskell.org/cabal (built from [cabal-website](https://github.com/haskell/cabal-website))
* www.haskell.org/platform (built from [haskell-platform](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-platform/tree/master/website))
* www.haskell.org/ghcup (build from [ghcup-hs](https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/ghcup-hs/-/tree/master/www)

### Contributing Changes

The easiest way to make changes is to use the `buildAndWatch` script and then
point your web browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). When
you are finished editing or want to re-build the hakyll part of the site, you
can stop the script by pressing `Control+c` (`C-c`).

If you are only making changes to the content of the site, you can leave this
script running and it will automatically pick up changes and re-build the site
for you.

If you want to change the `builder`, or if you encounter an error where your
changes to the content aren't being picked up, need to stop the script and
re-start it.

Once you're satisfied with your changes, make a PR and the maintainers will try
to review it as soon as we can.

### Working On The Builder

The `builder` is the static site generator that turns the markdown files, CSS,
images, and scripts into a website. It lives in the `builder`. Most of the time,
you won't need to make changes to the builder and you can follow the
instructions in the _Contributing Changes_ section above.

If you want to make a quick change or two, you can continue to use the
`buildAndWatch` script to rebuild changes, but for more substantial changes this
might increase the build cycle time too much. In this case, you can build the
builder using either nix or cabal. Directions for both are given below:

### Manually Building the Site With Cabal

If you don't have nix installed, or if you are inside of the project's nix
shell, you will want to use cabal to compile the builder. To do so, enter the
`builder` directory and compile the program with:

```shell
cabal v2-build
```

Once compiled, the builder must be run from the project root directory so that
it can find all of the content. To run the builder, you need to first find the
name of the executable. From the builder directory, you can find the executable
path by running:

```
find dist-newstyle -name 'haskell-org-site' -type f
```

Using that path, you can run the builder from the project root directory.

### Manually Building the Site With Nix

If you have nix installed, you can have nix build the builder by running:

```
nix-build -A builder
```

You may then run the builder binary from the `result` directory:

```
./result/bin/haskell-org-site build
```

### Deploying

The site will automatically be deployed live to <http://www.haskell.org/> every time a branch is merged to `master`. Alternatively an admin for this GitHub repository can deploy the site by visiting the [Deploy workflow page](https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/actions/workflows/deploy.yml), clicking the "Run workflow" dropdown, choosing the branch to build and deploy, and clicking the "Run workflow" button.
