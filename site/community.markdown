# Community

Haskellers interact, talk and collaborate across several mediums and around the world. There are places to learn, to teach, to ask questions, and to find contributors and collaborators.

[Help support the community!](/donations/)

## Online Communities and Social Resources


Haskellers are active on a number of online areas, but the most busy are below:

*   [The Haskell mailing lists](/mailing-lists/)
*   [IRC (online chat)](/irc/)

## Committees

Haskell infrastructure is mostly maintained by committees and groups of volunteers.  Here are some of the committees involved in keeping things running:

*   [Core Libraries Committee](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee)
*   [GHC Steering Committee](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals)
*   [Hackage trustees](https://wiki.haskell.org/Hackage_trustees)
*   [Haskell.org committee](/haskell-org-committee/)
*   [Stackage maintainers](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/maintainers/team_process/)
*   [Haskell admin team](https://github.com/haskell-infra/haskell-admins/): responsible for all `***.haskell.org` infrastructure, including this website.

## Conferences and Events

There are a number of conferences and events featuring Haskell, some focusing on the academic side of things, and some on the commercial or hobbyist side. Here are just a few:

### Academic Conferences

*   [The Haskell Symposium](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/)
*   [Haskell Implementors' Workshop](https://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop)
*   [The International Conference on Functional Programming](https://www.icfpconference.org/)
*   [Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/POPL/)
*   [International Symposia on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages](https://ifl-symposia.org/)
*   [Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming](https://trendsfp.github.io/)

### Non-Academic Conferences

*   [Commercial Users of Functional Programming (Roving)](http://cufp.org/)

## Specific Interest Groups

*   [Industrial Haskell Group](http://industry.haskell.org/)
*   [Commercial Haskell Group](https://commercialhaskell.com/)
