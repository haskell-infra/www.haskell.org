# Documentation

This page lists various resources to help you with Haskell. Resources marked with \[$$\] require payment.

If you are new to Haskell and are not sure where to start from, we recommend [CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html). CIS194 is the introductory Haskell course of the University of Pennsylvania; it is free, thorough, practical and will guide you from the basics to advanced features of the language.

## Manuals and Guides

Manuals and guides that cover common Haskell tooling:

*   [GHC User's Guide](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/)
*   [Cabal Homepage And Quick Links](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
*   [Cabal User Guide](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/)

*   [Haskeleton: A Haskell Project Skeleton](http://taylor.fausak.me/2014/03/04/haskeleton-a-haskell-project-skeleton/)
*   [How to Write a Haskell Program](https://wiki.haskell.org/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program)

## Package and Dependency Management

The Cabal guide is a good start but there's a lot to learn:

*   [Stephen Diehl's Cabal Quickstart](https://web.archive.org/web/20220513191346/http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#cabal)
*   [The Storage and Interpretation of Cabal Packages](http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/sicp.xhtml)
*   [The Cabal of Cabal](http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/cabal-cabal.xhtml)

## Library Documentation

Documentation for Haskell libraries is typically available on Hackage. We also have specialized tools for searching across it, not only by name, but by type.

*   [Hoogle API Search](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)
*   [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/)
*   [Stackage (with API Search)](https://www.stackage.org)
*   [The Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)
*   [Haddocks for Libraries included with GHC](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/index.html)

## Language Report

The Haskell 2010 language report is available online as [HTML](https://haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/) and as [PDF](https://haskell.org/definition/haskell2010.pdf). The [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-report). The differences between GHC and the report can be found [in the GHC User's Guide](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/bugs.html#haskell-standards-vs-glasgow-haskell-language-non-compliance).
