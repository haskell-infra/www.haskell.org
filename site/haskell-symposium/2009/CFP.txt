               ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2009

                       CALL FOR PAPERS

             http://haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2009/

   The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2009 will be co-located with the
   2009 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).

   The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experiences with
   Haskell and future developments for the language. The scope of the
   symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,
   application, implementation, and teaching of Haskell. 

   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
     * Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and
       modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the
       status quo;
     * Theory, in the form of a formal treatment of the semantics of the
       present language or future extensions, type systems, and
       foundations for program analysis and transformation;
     * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
       static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and
       distributed architectures, memory management as well as foreign
       function and component interfaces;
     * Tools, in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers,
       pre-processors, and so forth;
     * Applications, Practice, and Experience, with Haskell for scientific
       and symbolic computing, database, multimedia and Web applications,
       and so forth as well as general experience with Haskell in
       education and industry;
     * Functional Pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of using
       Haskell.

   Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report
   original research results; they may instead, for example, report
   practical experience that will be useful to others, re-usable
   programming idioms, or elegant new ways of approaching a
   problem. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a
   contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not
   enough simply to describe a program!

   Before 2008, the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell
   Workshop.  The name change reflects both the steady increase of
   influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community as well as
   the increasing number of high quality submissions. The acceptance
   process is highly competitive.  After eleven Haskell Workshops
   between 1995 and 2007, the first Haskell Symposium was held in
   Victoria in 2008.

Submission Details

     * Submission Deadline: Friday, May 8th 2009  (3:00 pm, Eastern US Time)
     * Author Notification: Monday, June 1st 2009
     * Final Papers Due   : Monday, June 15th 2009

   Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
   using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
   (http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The length is
   restricted to 12 pages, and the font size 9pt. Each submission must
   adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the web.
   Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission.

   Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM
   Digital Library.

   If there is sufficient demand, we will try to organize a time slot for
   system or tool demonstrations. If you are interested in demonstrating a
   Haskell related tool or application, please send a brief demo proposal
   to Stephanie Weirich, sweirich@cis.upenn.edu.
