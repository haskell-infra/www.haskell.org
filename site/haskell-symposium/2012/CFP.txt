                   ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2012
                          Copenhagen, Denmark
                          13th September, 2012
                          (directly after ICFP)

                            CALL FOR PAPERS

========================================================================


The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2012 will be co-located with the 2012
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), in
Copenhagen, Denmark.

The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experiences with
Haskell and future developments for the language. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

* Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications
  of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;

* Theory, such as formal treatments of the semantics of the present
  language or future extensions, type systems, and foundations for
  program analysis and transformation;

* Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static
  and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed
  architectures, memory management as well as foreign function and
  component interfaces;

* Tools, in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers, pre-processors,
  testing tools, and suchlike;

* Applications, using Haskell for scientific and symbolic computing,
  database, multimedia, telecom and web applications, and so forth;

* Functional Pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of using
  Haskell;

* Experience Reports, general practice and experience with Haskell,
  e.g., in an education or industry context.

Papers in the latter three categories need not necessarily report
original research results; they may instead, for example, report
practical experience that will be useful to others, reusable programming
idioms, or elegant new ways of approaching a problem. (Links with more
advice appear on the symposium web page.) The key criterion for such a
paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can
benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a program!

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both
general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished,
explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work (also
for other languages where appropriate).

In addition, we solicit proposals for system demonstrations, based on
running (perhaps prototype) software rather than necessarily on novel
research results. Such short demo proposals should explain why a
demonstration would be of interest to the Haskell community.


Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC programme, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).


Proceedings:
============

There will be formal proceedings published by ACM Press. In addition to
printed proceedings, accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital
Library. Authors must transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for
government work, to the extent transferable), but retain various rights
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy). Authors are
encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source code,
test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material.

Accepted demo proposals, assessed for relevance by the PC, will be
published on the symposium web page, but not formally published in the
proceedings.


Submission Details:
===================

* Abstract Submission: Thu 31st May 2012
* Paper Submission   : Sat 2nd June 2012 anywhere on inhabited Earth
                       (disregarding Baker and Howland Islands)
* Author Notification: Wed 27th June 2012
* Final Papers Due   : Tue 10th July 2012

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (9pt format, more details appear
on the symposium web page). The length is restricted to 12 pages, except
for "Experience Report" papers, which are restricted to 6 pages. Each
paper submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
explained on the web.

Demo proposals are limited to 2-page abstracts, in the same format.

"Functional Pearls", "Experience Reports", and "Demo Proposals" should
be marked as such with those words in the title at time of submission.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm. There
will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will
be summarily rejected.
