    ACM SIGPLAN
                HASKELL SYMPOSIUM 2013
                CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

    Boston, MA, USA, 23-24 September 2013, directly before ICFP

===================================================================


The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2013 will be colocated with the
2013 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
in Boston, MA, USA.  This year, the symposium will last 2 days
rather than 1 as in the past.  Thanks to broader participation
from a growing community, we will be able to include more regular
papers as well as system demonstrations and a new category of
panel discussions, while upholding the scientific quality of the
symposium.

The Haskell Symposium seeks to present original research on
Haskell, to discuss practical experience and future development
of the language, as well as to promote other forms of denotative
programming.  Topics of interest include

* Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and
  modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the
  status quo;

* Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or
  future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and
  foundations for program analysis and transformation;

* Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
  static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and
  distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign
  function and component interfaces;

* Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and
  testing tools;

* Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases,
  multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

* Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming
  examples;

* Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience
  in education, industry, or other contexts.

Papers in the latter three categories need not necessarily report
original research results.  They may report instead, for example,
reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem,
or practical experience that will be useful to other users,
implementors, or researchers.  (Links with more advice appear
on the symposium web page.)  The key criterion for such a paper
is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can
benefit.  It is not enough simply to describe a program!

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in
both general and technical terms, identifying what has been
accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to
previous work (also for other languages where appropriate).

In addition, we solicit proposals for

* System Demonstrations (no longer than a regular paper talk),
  based on running (perhaps prototype) software rather than
  necessarily on novel research results.

* Panel Discussions (no shorter than a regular paper talk),
  submitted by a moderator who proposes to bring together specific
  panelists who have agreed to address a specific pressing issue
  in the Haskell community.  Panels will subsume past "Future of
  Haskell" discussions.

These proposals should summarize the system capabilities that would
be demonstrated or the panelist positions that would be discussed.
The proposals should explain (and will be judged on) whether the
ensuing session is likely to be important and interesting to
the Haskell community at large, whether on grounds academic or
industrial, theoretical or practical, technical or social.  Please
contact the program chair with any questions about the relevance of
a proposal.


Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN
PAC grant to help cover travel expenses.  PAC also offers other
support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or
for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical
disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North
America and Europe.  For details on the PAC programme, see its web
page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).


Proceedings:
============

ACM Press will publish formal proceedings.  Accepted papers will
be included in the ACM Digital Library.  Authors must grant ACM
publication rights upon acceptance (http://authors.acm.org).
Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their
paper (source code, test data, etc.); they retain copyright of
auxiliary material.

Accepted demo and panel proposals will be posted on the symposium
web page, but not formally published in the proceedings.


Submission Details:
===================

* Abstract submission: Wed 12th June 2013, anywhere on earth
* Paper submission   : Fri 14th June 2013, anywhere on earth
* Demo submission    : Fri 14th June 2013, anywhere on earth
                       (prior abstract submission unnecessary)
* Panel submission   : Fri 28th June 2013, anywhere on earth
                       (prior abstract submission unnecessary)
* Author notification: Thu 11th July 2013
* Final papers due   : Thu 25th July 2013

Submitted papers should be in portable document format
(PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm).  The
text should be in a 9-point font in two columns.  The length is
restricted to 12 pages, except for "Experience Report" papers,
which are restricted to 6 pages.  Papers need not fill the page
limit -- for example, a Functional Pearl may be much shorter
than 12 pages.  Each paper submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's
republication policy, as explained on the web.

Demo and panel proposals are limited to 2-page abstracts, in the
same ACM format as papers.

"Functional Pearls", "Experience Reports", "Demo Proposals", and
"Panel Proposals" should be marked as such with those words in the
title at time of submission.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm.
There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length
limitations will be summarily rejected.

Submission is via EasyChair:
