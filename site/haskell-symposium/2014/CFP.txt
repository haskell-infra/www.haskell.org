                HASKELL SYMPOSIUM 2014
                CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

    Gothenburg, Sweden, 4-5 September 2014, directly after ICFP

===================================================================


The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2014 will be colocated with the 2014
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in
Gothenburg, Sweden. Like last year, the symposium will last 2 days.
Thanks to broader participation from a growing community, we will be
able to include more regular papers as well as system demonstrations,
while upholding the scientific quality of the symposium.

The Haskell Symposium seeks to present original research on Haskell,
to discuss practical experience and future development of the
language, as well as to promote other forms of denotative programming.
Topics of interest include

* Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and
  modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the
  status quo;

* Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future
  extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for
  program analysis and transformation;

* Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
  static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and
  distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign
  function and component interfaces;

* Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and
  testing tools;

* Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases,
  multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

* Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming
  examples;

* Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in
  education, industry, or other contexts. Such reports are shorter
  than regular papers; they are limited to six pages.

Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report
original research results.  They may report instead, for example,
reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or
practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementors,
or researchers.  The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a
contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit.  It is not
enough simply to describe a program!

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both
general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished,
explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work
(also for other languages where appropriate).

In addition, we solicit proposals for

* System Demonstrations (no longer than a regular paper talk), based
  on running (perhaps prototype) software rather than necessarily on
  novel research results.

These proposals should summarize the system capabilities that would be
demonstrated. The proposals should explain (and will be judged on)
whether the ensuing session is likely to be important and interesting
to the Haskell community at large, whether on grounds academic or
industrial, theoretical or practical, technical or social.  Please
contact the program chair with any questions about the relevance of a
proposal.


Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses.  PAC also offers other support,
such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs
for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well
as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe.  For
details on the PAC programme, see its web page
(http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).


Proceedings:
============

ACM Press will publish formal proceedings.  Accepted papers will be
included in the ACM Digital Library.  Authors must grant ACM
publication rights upon acceptance (http://authors.acm.org/main.html),
but may retain copyright if they wish.  Authors are encouraged to
publish auxiliary material with their paper (source code, test data,
and so forth).  The proceedings will be freely available for download
from the ACM Digital Library from one week before the start of the
conference until two weeks after the conference.

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the
symposium web page, but not formally published in the proceedings.

Submission Details:
===================

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm).  The text
should be in a 9-point font in two columns.  The length is restricted
to 12 pages, except for "Experience Report" papers, which are
restricted to 6 pages.  Papers need not fill the page limit.  Each
paper submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
explained on the web.

Proposals for system demonstrations are limited to 2-page abstracts,
in the same ACM format as papers.

"Functional Pearls", "Experience Reports", and "Demo Proposals" should
be marked as such with those words in the title at time of submission.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm.  There
will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations
will be summarily rejected.

Submission is via EasyChair:

  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=haskell14

* Abstract submission: Fri 09 May 2014
* Paper submission   : Mon 12 May 2014
* Demo submission    : Fri 30 May 2014
                       (prior abstract submission unnecessary)
* Author notification: Wed 11 June 2014
* Final papers due   : Sun 22 June 2014

All deadlines, except the final papers deadline, are in Standard
Samoan Time.
