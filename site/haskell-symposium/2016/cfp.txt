 ACM SIGPLAN                                      CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
                         Haskell Symposium 2016

         Nara, Japan, 22-23 September 2016, directly after ICFP
             http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2016
========================================================================

    ** The Haskell Symposium has an early track this year   **
    **      See the Submission Timetable for details.       **

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2016 will be co-located with the
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2016) in
Nara, Japan.

The Haskell Symposium aims to present original research on Haskell,
discuss practical experience and future development of the language, and
to promote other forms of denotative programming.

Topics of interest include:

* Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications
  of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;

* Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future
  extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for
  program analysis and transformation;

* Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static
  and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed
  architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and
  component interfaces;

* Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional
  programming in Haskell;

* Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and
  testing tools;

* Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases,
  multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

* Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples;

* Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in
  education, industry, or other contexts.

Papers in the latter three categories need not necessarily report
original academic research results. For example, they may instead report
reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or
practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementors,
or researchers. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a
contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough
simply to describe a standard solution to a standard programming
problem, or report on experience where you used Haskell in the standard
way and achieved the result you were expecting. More advice is available
via the Haskell wiki:
(http://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellSymposium/ExperienceReports)

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both
general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished,
explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and
to other languages where appropriate.

In addition, we solicit proposals for:

* System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel
  research results.

These proposals should summarize the system capabilities that would be
demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing
session is likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell
community at large, whether on grounds academic or industrial,
theoretical or practical, technical, social or artistic. Please contact
the program chair with any questions about the relevance of a proposal.

Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see its web page (http://pac.sigplan.org).

Proceedings:
============

Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors
must grant ACM publication rights upon acceptance
(http://authors.acm.org/main.html). Authors are encouraged to publish
auxiliary material with their paper (source code, test data, etc.); they
retain copyright of auxiliary material.

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the
symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings.

All accepted papers and proposals will be posted on the conference
website one week before the meeting.

Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers is
the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital
Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the
conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any
patent filings related to published work.

Submission Details:
===================

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The text should
be in a 9-point font in two columns. The length is restricted to 12
pages, except for "Experience Report" papers, which are restricted to 6
pages. Papers need not fill the page limit---for example, a Functional
Pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages. Each paper submission must
adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the web.

Demo proposals are limited to 2-page abstracts, in the same ACM format
as papers.

"Functional Pearls", "Experience Reports", and "Demo Proposals" should
be marked as such with those words in the title at time of submission.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm.  There
will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will
be summarily rejected.

Papers may be submitted at: https://icfp-haskell2016.hotcrp.com/

Submission Timetable:
=====================

               Early Track        Regular Track      System Demos
            ----------------   -------------------  ---------------
1st  April  Paper Submission

 6th June                      Abstract Submission
10th June                      Paper Submission

Deadlines stated are valid anywhere on earth.

The Haskell Symposium uses a two-track submission process so that some
papers can gain early feedback. Papers can be submitted to the early
track on 1st April. On 20th May, strong papers are accepted outright,
and the others will be given their reviews and invited to resubmit. On
17th June, early track papers may be resubmitted and are sent back to
the same reviewers. The Haskell Symposium regular track operates as in
previous years. Papers accepted via the early and regular tracks are
considered of equal value and will not be distinguished in the
proceedings.

Although all papers may be submitted to the early track, authors of
functional pearls and experience reports are particularly encouraged to
use this mechanism. The success of these papers depends heavily on the
way they are presented, and submitting early will give the program
committee a chance to provide feedback and help draw out the key ideas.
