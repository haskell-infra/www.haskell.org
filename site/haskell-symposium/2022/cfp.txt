 ACM SIGPLAN                                              CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

                          Haskell Symposium 2022

                            Ljubljana, Slovenia                           
                     Thu 15 -- Fri 16 September, 2022

              http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2022/

================================================================================

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2022 will be co-located with the 2022
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).

Differently from previous years, Haskell'22 will use a single-track submission 
process (that is, we will only have the regular track and no early track).

The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell,
discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and
promotes other forms of declarative programming.

Topics of interest include:

  * Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of
    Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;

  * Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future
    extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for
    program analysis and transformation;

  * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
    static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed
    architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and
    component interfaces;

  * Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional
    programming in Haskell;

  * Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors,
    and testing tools;

  * Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia,
    telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

  * Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples;

  * Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in
    education, industry, or other contexts;
    
  * Tutorials, to document how to use a particular language feature,
    programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem;

  * System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel
    research results.

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where
appropriate.

Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original
academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable
programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience
that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key
criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other
Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution
to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used
Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting.

Like an experience report and a functional pearl, tutorials should make 
a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. What distinguishes a 
tutorial is that its focus is on explaining an aspect of the Haskell language 
and/or ecosystem in a way that is generally useful to a Haskell audience. 
Tutorials for many such topics can be found online; the distinction here is that 
by writing it up for formal review it will be vetted by experts and formally published.

System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be
demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is
likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large,
whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical,
social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about
the relevance of a proposal.

If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your
experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such,
by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper, System Demonstration).

Submission Details
==================

Formatting
----------

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using
the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the `acmart` format, with
the `sigplan` sub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see:

  http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format

It is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper; 
this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.

Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be
labelled clearly as such.

Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing
----------------------------------

Haskell Symposium 2022 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.
To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

 1. Author names and institutions must be omitted, and
 2. References to authors' own related work should be in the third person
    (e.g., not "We build on our previous work" but rather "We build on the work of ").

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial
judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to
discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name
of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the
paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be
omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate
their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For
instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on
their research ideas.

A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review
is submitted.

Page Limits
-----------

The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits:

Regular paper:      12 pages
Functional pearl:   12 pages
Tutorial:           12 pages
Experience report:   6 pages
Demo proposal:       2 pages

There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a
functional pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages. In all cases,
the list of references is not counted against these page limits.

Deadlines
---------

Abstract submission:    27 May  2022      (Fri)
Paper submission:        3 June 2022      (Fri)
Notification:            1 July 2022      (Fri)


Deadlines are anywhere on Earth.

Submission
----------

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy
(http://sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/), and authors
should be aware of ACM's policies on plagiarism
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism).
Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will
be held to a higher standard.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm.
There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length
limitations will be summarily rejected.

Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at:

  https://haskell22.hotcrp.com/

Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the
submission deadline using the same web interface.

Supplementary material: Authors have the option to attach supplementary
material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not
to look at it. This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of
the main document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF document
or tarball. Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by
providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository.
Authors can distinguish between anonymized and non-anonymized supplementary
material. Anonymized supplementary material will be visible to reviewers
immediately; non-anonymized supplementary material will be revealed to
reviewers only after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned
the identity of the author(s).

Resubmitted Papers: authors who submit a revised version of a paper that has
previously been rejected by another conference have the option to attach an
annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), explaining how
they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submission. If a
reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and
wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the conference chair
will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous
review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of the previous
reviews.

Proceedings
===========

Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors 
will be required to choose one of the following options:
- Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive
  permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a
  Creative Commons license); 
- Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive
  permission-to-publish license; 
- Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
For more information, please see ACM Copyright Policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy) and ACM Author
Rights (http://authors.acm.org/main.html).

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the
symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings.

Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers is
the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital
Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the
conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any
patent filings related to published work.

Artifacts
=========

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artifacts
like source code, test data, etc.) available with their paper. They can opt to
have these artifacts published alongside their paper in the ACM Digital Library
(copyright of artifacts remains with the authors).

If an accepted paper's artifacts are made permanently available for retrieval in a
publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM Digital Library, that paper
qualifies for an Artifacts Available badge
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging#available).
Applications for such a badge can be made after paper acceptance and will be
reviewed by the PC chair.
