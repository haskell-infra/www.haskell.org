                          Haskell Symposium 2018

                       St. Louis, MO, United States
                          27--28 September, 2018

              http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2018/

================================================================================

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2018 will be co-located with the 2018
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP),
in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.

The Haskell Symposium aims to present original research on Haskell,
discuss practical experience and future development of the language, and to
promote other forms of denotative programming.

Topics of interest include:

  * Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of
    Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;

  * Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future
    extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for
    program analysis and transformation;

  * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
    static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed
    architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and
    component interfaces;

  * Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional
    programming in Haskell;

  * Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors,
    and testing tools;

  * Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia,
    telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

  * Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples;

  * Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in
    education, industry, or other contexts.
  * System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel
    research results.

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where
appropriate.

Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original
academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable
programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience
that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key
criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other
Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution
to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used
Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting. More
advice is available via the Haskell wiki.

System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be
demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is
likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large,
whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical,
social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about
the relevance of a proposal.


Submission Details
==================

Early and Regular Track
-----------------------

The Haskell Symposium uses a two-track submission
process so that some papers can gain early feedback. Strong papers submitted to
the early track are accepted outright, and the others will be given their
reviews and invited to resubmit to the regular track. Papers accepted via the
early and regular tracks are considered of equal value and will not be
distinguished in the proceedings. Although all papers may be submitted to the
early track, authors of functional pearls and experience reports are
particularly encouraged to use this mechanism. The success of these papers
depends heavily on the way they are presented, and submitting early will give
the program committee a chance to provide feedback and help draw out the key
ideas.

Formatting
----------

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines.  Authors should use the
`acmart` format, with the `sigplan` sub-format for ACM proceedings.
For details, see:

  http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format

Functional pearls, experience reports, and demo proposals should be
labelled clearly as such.
Paper submissions should not be anonymous.

Page Limits
-----------

The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits:

Regular paper:      12 pages
Functional pearl:   12 pages
Experience report:   6 pages
Demo proposal:       2 pages

There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a
functional pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages.

Deadlines
---------

Early track:
  Submission deadline:    30 March 2018     (Fri)
  Notification:           18 May   2018     (Fri)

Regular track and demos:
  Submission deadline:     8 June 2018      (Fri)
  Notification:           13 July 2018      (Fri)

Deadlines are valid anywhere on Earth.

Submission
----------

Submissions should adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy,
as explained on the web.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm.
There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length
limitations will be summarily rejected.

Papers should be submitted through easychair at:

  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=haskell2018


Travel Support
==============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to
help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as for
child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of
SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from
locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC program,
see its web page (http://pac.sigplan.org).


Proceedings
===========

Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
ACM publication rights upon acceptance (http://authors.acm.org/main.html).
Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source
code, test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material.

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the
symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings.

All accepted papers and proposals will be posted on the conference
website one week before the meeting.

Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers is
the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital
Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the
conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any
patent filings related to published work.
