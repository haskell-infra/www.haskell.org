>Conflicts arise from ambiguities in the grammar.  That is,
      some input sequences may possess more than one parse.
      Shift/reduce conflicts are benign in the sense that they are
      easily resolved (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Happy</SPAN
> automatically selects the
      shift action, as this is usually the intended one).
      Reduce/reduce conflicts are more serious.  A reduce/reduce
      conflict implies that a certain sequence of tokens on the input
      can represent more than one non-terminal, and the parser is
      uncertain as to which reduction rule to use.  It will select the
      reduction rule uppermost in the grammar file, so if you really
      must have a reduce/reduce conflict you can select which rule
      will be used by putting it first in your grammar file.</P

>It is usually possible to remove conflicts from the
      grammar, but sometimes this is at the expense of clarity and
      simplicity.  Here is a cut-down example from the grammar of
      Haskell (1.2):</P

>and the ambiguity shows up as a shift/reduce conflict on
      reading the 'op' symbol.  In this case, the first parse is the
      intended one (the 'longest parse' rule), which corresponds to
      the shift action.  Removing this conflict relies on noticing
      that the expression on the left-hand side of an infix operator
      can't be an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>exp0</TT
> (the grammar previously said
      otherwise, but since the conflict was resolved as shift, this
      parse was not allowed).  We can reformulate the
      <TT

>exp</TT
> rule as:</P

>and this removes the conflict, but at the expense of some
      stack space while parsing (we turned a left-recursion into a
      right-recursion).  There are alternatives using left-recursion,
      but they all involve adding extra states to the parser, so most
      programmers will prefer to keep the conflict in favour of a
      clearer and more efficient parser.</P

>There are three basic ways to build a shift-reduce
        parser.  Full LR(1) (the `L' is the direction in which the
        input is scanned, the `R' is the way in which the parse is
        built, and the `1' is the number of tokens of lookahead)
        generates a parser with many states, and is therefore large
        and slow.  SLR(1) (simple LR(1)) is a cut-down version of
        LR(1) which generates parsers with roughly one-tenth as many
        states, but lacks the power to parse many grammars (it finds
        conflicts in grammars which have none under LR(1)). </P
><P
>LALR(1) (look-ahead LR(1)), the method used by
        <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Happy</SPAN
> and
        <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>yacc</SPAN
>, is tradeoff between the two.
        An LALR(1) parser has the same number of states as an SLR(1)
        parser, but it uses a more complex method to calculate the
        lookahead tokens that are valid at each point, and resolves
        many of the conflicts that SLR(1) finds.  However, there may
        still be conflicts in an LALR(1) parser that wouldn't be there
        with full LR(1).</P
