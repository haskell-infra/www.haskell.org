ANNOUNCING Happy 1.16  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell

I'm pleased to announce version 1.16 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.

Changes from version 1.15 to 1.16

	* Switch to a Cabal build system: you need a recent version of Cabal
	  (1.1.6 or later).  If you have GHC 6.4.2, then you need to upgrade
	  Cabal before building Happy.  GHC 6.6 is fine.

	* New %error directive

	* New production forms: {%% .. } and {%^ .. }

	* Added Attribute Grammar support, by Robert Dockins

NOTE: Happy version 1.16 is required for building GHC version 6.6 and
later.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 5.04+, and we also provide binaries for some architectures.
The Happy homepage with links to the various distributions lives at:
