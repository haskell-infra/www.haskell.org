<P>
<P>Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool
<CODE>yacc</CODE> for C.  Like <CODE>yacc</CODE>, it takes a file containing an
annotated BNF specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module
containing a parser for the grammar.
<P>Happy is flexible; unlike <CODE>yacc</CODE>, you can have several Happy
parsers in the same program.  Happy can work in conjunction with a
lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or
generated by another program), or it can parse a stream of characters
directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).  In a future
version we hope to include a lexical analyser generator with Happy as
a single package.
<P>Parsers generated by Happy are fast; generally faster than an
equivalent parser written using parsing combinators or similar tools.
Furthermore, any future improvements made to Happy will benefit an
existing grammar, without need for a rewrite.
<P>Happy is sufficiently powerful to parse Haskell itself - there's a
freely available Haskell parser written using Happy which can be
obtained from 
<A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simonm/hsparse.tar.gz">http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simonm/hsparse.tar.gz</A>.
<P>Happy can currently generate three types of parser from a given grammar,
the intention being that we can experiment with different kinds of
functional code to see which is the best, and compiler writers can use
the different types of parser to tune their compilers.  The types of
parser supported are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> `standard' Haskell 1.4 (should work with any compiler that
compiles Haskell 1.4).
</LI>
<LI> standard Haskell using arrays (this is not the default because
we have found this generates slower parsers than 1).
</LI>
<LI> Haskell with GHC (Glasgow Haskell) extensions.  This is a
slightly faster option than 1 for Glasgow Haskell users.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:compatibility"></A> <A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Compatibility</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Happy is written in Haskell 1.4. This means that it will compile under
Glasgow Haskell (recommended), hbc, Hugs, and any other Haskell 1.4
compiler.
<P>Remember: parsers produced using Happy should compile happily (sic)
under any Haskell 1.4 complier.  A compatibility mode enables Happy to
generate parsers that will compile with a Haskell 1.2 compiler, such
as GHC 0.29.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:reporting-bugs"></A> <A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Reporting Bugs</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Any bugs found in Happy should be reported to me (Simon Marlow
<A HREF="mailto:simonm@dcs.gla.ac.uk">simonm@dcs.gla.ac.uk</A>) including all the relevant information:
- the compiler used to compile Happy, the command-line options used,
your grammar file or a cut-down example showing the problem, and a
description of what goes wrong.  A patch to fix the problem would also
be greatly appreciated.
<P>Requests for new features should also be sent to the above address,
especially if accompanied by patches.  You never know, if I get
another request to implement yacc-style precedences, I might just do
it :-)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:license"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 License</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Previous versions of Happy were covered by the GNU general public
license.  We're now distributing Happy with a less restrictive
license:
<P>Happy may be freely distributed in source or binary form, provided:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Source distributions must retain the enclosed <CODE>LICENSE</CODE>
file, and copyright attributions on each source file.  
</LI>
<LI> Binary distributions must contain the <CODE>LICENSE</CODE> file either
as part of the distribution or in accompanying electronic or printed
material.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Aside from these restrictions, you can do what you like with Happy.
