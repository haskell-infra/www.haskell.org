# Support the Community

A significant part of the Haskell community infrastructure—like Hackage, Hoogle, the GHC build infrastructure and this website—runs on monetary and in-kind donations from the Haskell community. If you would like to support these efforts, you have several options for donating:

  * PayPal (preferred)
  
      <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TED2EBG653TAN"><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" alt="btn_donate_LG.gif"></a>
  
  * Checks payable to Haskell.org, Inc. mailed to:
  
    > Haskell.org, Inc. c/o Ryan Trinkle, Treasurer
    >
    > 2093 Philadelphia Pike #8119
    >
    > Claymont, DE 19703
  
  * [Amazon Smile][smile], where you can select Haskell.org to receive 0.5% of your eligible Amazon purchases ([more details][smile-details]).
  
  * Donations through employers via Benevity using the unique ID 475236502

  * Through SPI - Haskell.org is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest, also a registered non-profit organization under the laws of New York State. Donations via the SPI can be made online via credit card, invoice, PO or eCheck through clickandpledge.com or by mailing an earmarked check directly to SPI: http://www.spi-inc.org/donations/. Recurring donations can be set up in addition to one-time donations. Note that donations through SPI require more overhead from the Committee, so we encourage you to use the other ways of donating.

Haskell.org is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, so donations may be tax-deductible in your jurisdiction.

### Why should I donate?

To make a concrete contribution to the maintenance and development of Haskell community infrastructure, including the hosting and deployment of community resources, from Hackage to Hoogle and beyond, the best thing to do is find a way to volunteer and get involved! However, donations are also very welcome and needed. We will find ways to put donations to good use, be they for infrastructure administration, new hardware, or continued work on software infrastructure projects.

Some particular aspects of the work of Haskell.org include producing and maintaining material regarding the Haskell language on haskell.org and other associated websites; hosting and maintaining shared assets and infrastructure for the benefit of the Haskell community; coordinating educational activities including mentorship programs; and potentially organizing event regarding the Haskell language.

Responsibility for the activities of haskell.org lies with the haskell.org committee, which serves as its board of directors.
