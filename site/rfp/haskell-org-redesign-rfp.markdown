title: Haskell.org Redesign RFP
page: haskell-org-redesign-rfp
---

# Current Status

This RFP is currently **Open** and we are actively soliciting proposals.

# Introduction

Haskell.org, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, operates and maintains the
website at [http://haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org). Our team, primarily
composed of committed volunteers, is dedicated to expanding the recognition of
Haskell and fueling broader interest in the language. We are seeking proposals
for a website redesign project to update and improve our site's visual design,
thereby enhancing the user experience for our community.

# Budget and Scope

Haskell.org has allocated up to 2500 USD for this project. The scope
of work includes a visual overhaul of several key pages on haskell.org,
specifically the pages titled:

-   Get Started
-   Downloads
-   Community
-   Documentation
-   Donate

The visual overhaul may include, but is not limited to, changes to the
layout of the pages, the creation of new graphics and icons, and
requests to the Haskell.org committee for new text content to be
included on the pages.

The redesign of these pages should follow a cohesive visual style and
design language that matches with the design of the haskell.org home
page. Additionally, while we do not seek a complete visual overhaul to
the home page of haskell.org, we anticipate that there may be some minor
changes to this page to conform to changes elsewhere on the site. Please
note that only pages that are part of the primary [haskell.org
site](<https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org>) are in scope
for this project.

We are open to proposals covering a reduced scope of work, as long as
the end result is production-ready. The final deliverables for this
project should include all necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
template changes, etc.) and assets (images, fonts) required for the
site's overhaul. While this is a design-centric project, any minimal
content changes or copywriting adjustments required to accommodate the
new design should be included.

# Technical Requirements

Specific technical requirements for the work and deliverables will be
determined in collaboration with the selected party. However, it's
vital for proposers to understand the unique constraints and context of
Haskell.org:

-   We are a non-profit organization with a limited budget.
-   We don't have dedicated full-time staff, so ease of ongoing
    maintenance is a significant factor in our review of proposals.

Our current website is statically generated using Hakyll, and its
content is primarily crafted with markdown, CSS, and a sprinkle of
JavaScript. The committee and our dedicated volunteers are
well-acquainted with these technologies. Proposals that extend and
enhance the existing infrastructure, rather than suggesting a full
replacement, will be particularly appealing to us. We anticipate that
given the limited scope of this project, most proposers will opt to
build upon our current foundation.

Other essential technical considerations include:

-   Ensuring site accessibility.
-   Compliance with GDPR.
-   Any implications for hosting, maintenance, or licensing in the
    future.

# Proposal

Proposals should be emailed to the Haskell.org committee at
committee@haskell.org. Proposals may be submitted at any time, and will
be reviewed as they are received until an appropriate proposal has been
selected. Proposals need not be formal but should include at least:

-   A detailed summary of the work to be completed.
-   An estimate for the total time to deliver the project.
-   Any additional services provided such as support and maintenance
    post-implementation.
-   An overview of your relevant experience and past portfolio, if any.
-   Any potential challenges you foresee and how you plan to address
    them.

# Selection and Notification Process

Proposals will be reviewed by the Haskell.org committee. Each proposal
will be evaluated based on its thoroughness, the feasibility of the
timeline, the proposer's relevant experience, and alignment with the
budget. We may reach out to the proposers for further information or
clarification during the review process.

The selected proposer will be notified by email as soon as the committee has
reached a decision. Once a proposer is selected, a contract detailing the scope
of work, payment terms, and other project specifics will be negotiated. Upon
acceptance of a proposal, other submitters will be notified via email.

# Contact Information

For any questions or clarifications related to this RFP, please contact
the Haskell.org committee at committee@haskell.org.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. We look forward to your
creative and innovative proposals.
