# Haskell.org

Haskell.org, Inc. is a Not-for-Profit Corporation incorporated in the State of
New York. It is also exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the US
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A committee of Haskell.org, Inc. (the Committee)
oversees the Haskell.org website and a number of other services for the Haskell
community:

  * [Hackage], Haskell's largest open package repository
  * [GHC] pages and release infrastructure
  * [Haskell Wiki][wiki]
  * [mailing lists][mailing]
  * [Discourse][discourse]
  * [Hoogle], a type-aware Haskell search engine

The corporation is formed to promote scientific progress and education relating
to the Haskell programming language and related technologies.

Some particular aspects of the work of the corporation include producing and
maintaining material regarding the Haskell language on haskell.org and other
associated websites; hosting and maintaining shared assets and infrastructure
for the benefit of the Haskell community; coordinating educational activities
including mentorship programs; and potentially organizing events regarding the
Haskell language.

The corporation also organizes Haskell's participation in the
[Google Summer of Code program][gsoc].

### Contact

  * [committee@haskell.org][email]: directly email the Committee
  * [haskell-community mailing list][list]: public discussions about the
    Committee and Haskell community infrastructure
  * [GitHub][github]: issues, suggestions and pull requests for the website
  * [Haskell.org proposals][repo]: submit community proposals for Haskell.org

## Haskell.org Bylaws

The bylaws of the corporation are published
[here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/hf/meta/-/blob/main/bylaws/Bylaws_of_Haskell.org_Inc.md).

The directors of the corporation are also directors of
[Haskell Foundation, Inc.](https://haskell.foundation/).

## Haskell.org Committee

The responsibilities of the Committee include:

  * setting the policy for [haskell.org] domain and subdomains
  * setting policy for servers owned or financed by Haskell.org
  * overseeing certain Haskell.org donations and funds

### Committee Membership

The committee consists of 7 members serving 3-year terms. The current members
are:

  * Avi Press (term ends 2026)
  * Matthías Páll Gissurarson (term ends 2026)
  * Moritz Angermann (term ends 2026)
  * Rebecca Skinner (term ends 2025)
  * Théophile "Hécate" Choutri (term ends 2025)
  * Aaron Allen (term ends 2025)
  * Tom Ellis (vice chair, vice treasurer) (term ends 2024)

Committee members do not need to be deep technical Haskell experts. Instead we
look for enthusiasm towards improving the Haskell community. We aim to represent
the different facets of the community. We aim to be diverse in terms of industry
or research, and in terms of gender, race and location.

### Process

* The Committee follows the governing rules laid out in the corporation's
  [Board Resolution](/2015-11-10-Haskell-Org-Board-Resolution.pdf) of
  10 November 2015.
* The Committee uses the [haskell-community mailing list][list] for public
  discussion, where all interested parties may participate.
* Proposals and meeting notes are stored in a [public repository][repo].
* The Committee will seek to reach consensus among its membership on its
  decisions. Ultimately, the Committee will make decisions by more than half of
  the membership voting for a particular outcome.
* These rules of operation may also be changed in the same way.

#### Committee Membership

The Committee consists of 7 members. Members are expected to serve a 3 year
term, and terms are staggered so that 2 or 3 members step down each year, at the
end of October.

The members will elect one of their number to be chair each year. The chair is
responsible for making sure that things keep moving, and to ensure that a
conclusion is reached on any issues raised.

In November of each year—or if a member steps down before their term is over—the
committee holds an open call for new members, encouraging self-nominations.
Committee members whose terms are over are eligible for renomination.

After nominations have been solicited, the current Committee—including any
outgoing members not seeking reelection—selects new members with a simple
majority vote.

While this has never occurred in the past, Committee members can also be removed
by majority vote.

### History

The initial Haskell.org committee was
[formed in November 2010](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2010-November/022375.html).
As described there:

> In recent years, haskell.org has started to receive assets, e.g. Google Summer
Of Code funds, donations for Hackathons, and a Sparc machine for use in GHC
development. We have also started spending this money: on the community server,
on a server to take over hosting haskell.org itself, and on the haskell.org
domain name. There is also interest in running fundraising drives for specific
things such as Hackathon sponsorship and hosting fees.

> To resolve who is responsible for haskell.org’s infrastructure development,
open nominations were held to form a haskell.org committee, based on
representatives from the open source Haskell community.

Haskell.org, Inc. was subsequently incorporated on 28 September 2015, with
DOS ID 4825953.
