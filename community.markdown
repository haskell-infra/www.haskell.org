# Community

Haskellers interact, talk and collaborate across several mediums and around the world. There are places to learn, to teach, to ask questions, and to find contributors and collaborators.

## Online Communities and Social Resources

Haskellers are active on a number of online areas, but the most busy are below:

*   [The Haskell mailing lists](/mailing-lists/)
*   [IRC (online chat)](/irc/)
*   [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=haskell)
*   [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/programming.haskell/)
*   [theTUNDRA community](https://thetundra.com/interests/tech/groups/haskell-the-haskell-beginners-community)
